Documentation for Breakable Pots

The pots themselves are simple meshes using a custom collision mesh and a custom shader to allow some variation
in hue and brightness.

The broken versions of the pot are much more complex in geometry and are set up with
a mesh collider and rigidbody to fall using the physics in unity.

The breakable script is put on the intact model and is responsible for how the breaking can be
triggered and what happens to it after that. When a break happens the script will remove the components
that were responsible for showing the intact version and instantiate the broken version. 

That breaking can be accessed via a public method, which is demonstrated by the bomb script, which also 
drives the effects on that prefab.

The bomb has several parts: The body is just a regular mesh with a simple shader, the fuse which has a special
shader to make it burn down when the script changes the according parameter in the material and finally two vfx graph
effcts. One is just the sparks of the fuse while the other is the actual explosion.

The same bomb script then uses the second script, the impulse, to actually call the public functions on the breakable script
the pots have to make them break, as well as some physics code to apply force to the broken parks so it all looks the part.
